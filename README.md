# LexicalAnalyzer
In this repository we create a lexical analyzer that works to analyze nanoC and convert it into a token stream. THis is part of a submission to CS1319 Program Language Design and Implementation. The specification to the assignment can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/17_Euz51EwuzNpOFmfZR3wU2qO_-vOGU0/view?usp=sharing
